# Jenkins Pipeline Test (TaskD)

## Questions

### How did you test your pipelines?

1. create a jenkins instance from docker compose.\
   repo: <https://github.com/RiddlerKnight/jenkins-work>

2. Create Doxygen config then run test with GRPC repo that I was forked from so that I need to understand how it work.

3. Create Pipeline script (groovy file) and put the script through GUI.

4. Manually start the pipeline.

### How did you test repoC python?

Same as the instruction above. For the python script, I have exported the log from the TaskB as an example. When it worked well, I put it in the groovy script.
